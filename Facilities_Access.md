Proposal to create a standard membership agreements to guarantee facilities access - in this case access to machineries produced on-site by the project and to performe regenerative agriculture activities. 

Proposal concerns membership of entities and/or individuals 

to be part of the network 
to use the machinery 
to produce the machinery 

As the machinery can be used in different ways a good practice to guarantee a regnerative impact of the production system, it would be to create a standard membership agreement embedding a contract to peg the use to specific conditions deeply embedded into the regenerative - organic attitude.

Breaking the membership agreement would entitle the project to claim a compensative fine equal to the profit that came from an extractive attitude in the use of the machinery. Would also compromise the use license for the partner involved in such disfunctional dynamics. A system of incentives for the correct use of the machinery can also be designed in order to prevent such typologies of conflicts/disfunctional behaviours.

We can think to embed the use license clause within the membership agreement also giving access to all other incentives,services and products provided. This can also help modelling the BM of the company toward a regenerative impact attitude.

The verification of regenerative attitudes among partners = members can also happens through blockchain kii - key impact indicators in connection with the machinery functioning. 
(for example to avoid monoculture : 

- insert clause about minum cultivars to be planted within a specific space - example 20 different cultivars x 50 square meters;
- to enhance biodiversity safeguard and seeds keeping - guarantee at least 50 plants per specie to be left for seeds production; 
- to build soil - guarantee that at least the 30% of planted species will be left on ground as fertilizer;
- to strenghten the species: to guarantee that al least Â¾ of the tunnels will apply bees pollination and will use biological control. Biological control in agriculture employs biological entities or molecules derived from living organisms to control the growth of pathogenic organisms or parasites and contain their harmful activity.)

This is a BP template produced for developing a Business activity within the Liminal Village hub of services framework - Feb 2023

BUSINESS PLAN INDEX – Project Title (plus acronym is better)

1. # Intro and Abstract – Functional synthesis
This is the most important part is usually filled at the end of the project design process – is the 15-
20 lines pitch that serves to CAPTURE the attention of potential project stakeholders

2. # Context Analysis and Feasibility
In this section is usually described the context of reference in which the project idea was born,
differentiating it from the context in which the project will actually live and the connection
between the two. Also potential replication opportunities in connection with scale-up possibilities
are useful. Description of sectoral best practices at different levels (local, national, bioregional,
EU, Global). Analysis and indication of local needs, issues and challenges with specification
concerning typologies of reference (structural systemic, social, cultural, pschological, functional,
competencies, ect...). Demonstration of technical feasibility showing the coherence among
resources (available and needed), activities and timing. Coherence with the funding scheme of
reference (if applicable).

3. # Strategy of reference, project aims and objectives
In this section there would be references to the context deepening the issues, needs, challenges
framework and introducing the project strategic orientation listing conseguently projects aims and
objectives. Illustration of proposed solutions and priorities in connections with wider
development strategies at project, local, national, bioregional, EU, global level. General mentions
to digital tech, innovation, sustainability, resilience, systemic crisis challenges, ect...legal
framework references (if applicable).

4. # Description of Project Activities
In this section Working Packages, Tasks, Subtasks, Milestones, deliverables and outputs are
described in detail. Internal coherence of the project and adherence of the strategy, aims and
objectives with the activities is highlighted. The “Who is doing what” part will serve as an
introduction for the working group presentation. A complete timeline for project development and
a complete GANTT will also be designed. A general introduction to operational capacity will be
provided.

5. # Project Core group, working group, partners
In this section there will be a clear description of the project core group. Coordination and
communication dynamics, governance and leadership; decision-making methodologies. Human
resources available in connection with activities to duly demonstrate operational capacity.
Partners available to duly demonstrate both operational and financial capacity. Description of the
legal entity entitled to act as funding recipient and entitled to contract on legal responsibilities in
connection with project activities and project development.

6. # Outreach strategies, network building and stakeholders mapping.
In this section will be described how the stakeholder mapping process have been designed and
how the networking work will feed and support the project. Also the benefits deriving from the
project toward the environment and the project partners will be listed and illustrated. A
transparent description of:
- core members motivation/interests
- partners motivation/interests
- human resources available motivation/interests
- core group, human resources, partners contributions/investiments
- foreseen yields division (on the base of core group members and partners
contributions/investments)
will also be provided in detail. The discussion will include and illustrate different mechanisms
managing and balancing transactional equilibria on the base of contributions at different levels
This section is a stepping stone showing the fundaments of the project network growth and
thriving dynamics on the mid-long term.

7. # Financial capacity and fundraising strategy
In this section it will be described the methodology used in connection with project aims and
objectives, resources and activities to launch the project, sustain it during the start-up phase and
guarantee its mid-long term sustainability. Different levels can be illustrated, there where different
schemes will be combined to guarantee the project stability. In kind contributon-rewards
mechanisms, grants, donors (crowdfunding-crowdsourcing), angel investors, profit reinvestment,
Trad-Fi financial incentives, DeFi tokenization. It's important to underline that this description
will describe a fundraising strategy not essentially focused on pure economic-financial resources
accumulation. Final aim will be to demonstrate how financial and operational capacities can both
feed each other creating frameworks of independence of the project guaranteeing its stability in
systemic cyclical crisis too.

8. # Fundraising strategy through financial products
This section will be totally based on the analysis and the description of :
- TradFi products used
- DeFi products used.
The document will also describe the opportunity of integration of the scheme with long-term
financial stability creation within these mechanisms.

9. # Monitoring, Verification and Evaluation
In this section it will be described the methodology used to monitor, verify and evaluate the
project. Key indicators will also be listed, together with the illustration of the detailed timeline for
production of deliverables and outputs. How these are connected with the project development and
how corrective measures will be inserted in connection with risks mitigation.

10. # Risks
This section will provide a complete description concerning project risks in failing its aims,
diverging from the original strategy and compromise project stability and duration on the long
term. A complete set of risk management measures will also be provided together with project
adjustment procedures on periodical feedback loops.

11. # Project coordination technologies and development methodologies.
In this section it will be provided a complete illustration of the methodologies used to support the
project development, which coordination technologies will be used to enable functional decision-
making processes, to create an healthy governance dynamic and to distribute efficiently tasks in
order for them to be properly and punctually executed. Also some automation features could be
introduced and duly mentioned opening the doors to automation in project management contexts.

12. # Value proposition and innovation
In this section overall project proposition will be illustrated. Clear mentions to all innovative
approaches, methodologies and technologies used to coordinate, develop and guarantee the
project stable thriving will also be presented. Why the project creates added value for users,
partners and the network and how this value proposition differs from the others presented in other
similar frameworks, also how it can be combined to other value propositions presented by
different projects acting within different frameworks and networks but within a common strategy.
“Symbolic interoperability” of the project could be here duly presented.

13. # Impact
In this section all elements connected with the impact the projects want to create, how the impact
creation process has been designed, how it will be monitored and evaluated (including indicators
and reporting tools and methods, verificators competencies, ect...) verification and certification
will be duly illustrated. Short-term, Mid-term, long-term perspective on impact evolution within
the project evolution perspective.

14. # Evolutive Model Approach toward and Evolutive Design
This section will describe how the project will be periodically redesigned to answer to the needs of
the reality/ies it wants to impact on within a specific development strategy. This section will
demonstrate how reiterated impacting projects can redirect specific dynamics and reorientate
systemic agents toward regenerative purposes. This section represent the final connection between
the project design and modelling here exposed and the potential creation of a regenerative design
methodology applicable to social projects as well as business modelling. Such methodology can
open the pathway to regenerative transitioning trails for organizations, institutions and economic-
financial actors. Final scope of the evolutive design approach is to allow systemic operators to
transcend their functioning models and adapt them to the regenerative needs of the planet and the
communities they operate in.

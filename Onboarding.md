This proposal will be submitted directly to Liminal Village from my Github repository 

Onboarding processes should include personal projects presentation. Persons willing to visit the project for more than one lunation or stay on site for a period longer than 2 weeks should present a complete project proposal to present their contribution to the project development on site.
Liminal could provide a set of priorities connected with project's development needs and interested visitors could adapt their projects to those priorities or highlight the connections between their project and those priorities.
Onboarding - Selection process shall also take into consideration these proposals over than overall assessment of applicant abilities and potential contribution to the project development or even to the network development.
Onboarding processes shall be transparent as well as applicants assessment procedures - so onboarding interviews recorded if agreed by the participatns and stored to be accessible to everyone in the network. Same for all relevant documentation produced within the onboarding process, including of course the proposal.
All sort of contribution coming from the applicant shall be transaprently tracked and accounted - from tools sharing, gifts, contribution to the overal project development, comments about projects dynamics, analysis, work done on field
Trial periods shall be organized to accept staying of over 6 months - basic trial period : 2 weeks
More project core members need to assess the applicant - not only the main owners or residents or stewards - multiple assessment is stricly needed
Application forms shall be public and accessible to all network members if agreed by the applicant. Further documentation provided by the applicant shall be publically available if agreed by the applicant 
Level of publicity of the onboarding process shall be decided on a consensus base with the applicant.
Reputation rating of the applicant on multiple assessment shall be set in place and make public 
Periodical reviews on applicant performance with public final assessment shall be also available for the network 

These basic procedures aim to protect the applicant from ambiguity - several projects are run by people having resources and strong systems of support - majority of applicants could be potentially considered as "system's refugees" - vulnerable people that can be easily manipulated and damaged.
The transparency of the onboarding processes is a guarantee for the hosts as well as for the applicant - transparent onboarding processes guarantee for the applicant the creation of a strong system of support shielding them from potential (even unwated) misbehaviours by the hosts or performed damaging the hosts as well as strong shield and protection from power abuses coming usually from the hosts as they have the property of the place and the facilities.
Transparent onboarding and periodical assessment processes can guarantee the basic rights of the applicants as well as the ones of the hosts - avoiding people to be suddenly kicked out of projects putting up excuses or people forced in leaving and blamed for that. On the other side this also gives the hosts the security that applicants will take faith to their commitments before leaving the projects.
Transparent documentation of the interaction with applicants can also serve as base for network participated conflict resolution processes - this meaning whatever members of the network coming from whatever project can take part into a conflict resolution process that needs to be transparent, accessible and public as well .

Transparent acceptance of clear agreements is also an asset - 
Clear transparent requests toward the applicants at whatever level must be transparent and noticed to all network 
On the other side commitments from the applicants must also be transparent and noticed to all network 

Verification on agreements/commitments respect is basic - all requests needs to be explicit and verbally communicated to the applicant - not explicit requests will not be taken into consideration for performance assessment or agreements/commitments verification - nor accountable for reputation

# Proposals-
Proposals for Projects Development 

This repository collects all the proposals I will produce while visiting regenerative projects. It has the scope of serving all the network.
Projects can take inspiration from my proposals and adapt them to their contexts of reference.
People from the projects willing to go deeper into proposals realization on projects' site can contact me and ask me to support the process at distance or on-site.
My main expectation in setting-up this repository is to develop best practices for projects development and help regenerative projects to expand and thrive on the base of my experience of the past and present.
I also would like to connect this repository to my nomadic attitude and so to serve projects at distance as well as visiting them and taking care of supporting the development of one or more proposals I already took care of in ther projects - of course taking actively part in the adaptation process as I am fully aware none project is exactly the same of another.
For whatever request of support, doubts or simple questions, please don't hesistate in reaching out to issorsimona@fastmail.com.

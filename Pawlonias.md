Pawlonias planting in the area

Here a description of the plant - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulownia_tomentosa
The variety offered by Pawlonias Piemonte are highly selected to sequester more CO2 than possible. Moreover, the plants are sterile so to avoid endemic expansion of a species that is in the reintroduction process in Europe

Pawlonias when very small need water at least for the first year. They thrive in very degraded soils and have no problems in adapting to clay soil. Shade is also highly beneficial for them. They can be used as support within the lines and pruned regurarly. 
Their wood can also be used for sale additional revenue from the lines. 
There is only one problem they are not in the first stages of the succession in the syntropic logic so they need more inputs and attention if planted in systems that are not ready to receive them. 
Every Pawlonia will give us an income of 2â‚¬. The plan is to plant the first 600 in October around the property and in the Caravan/tents area so as to have shade and consider that the irrigation system is already in place. 

Here is a Photo of the first proposal also modifiable through LibreCAD - the original file will be uploaded on the telegram group dedicated to land regeneration at Liminal

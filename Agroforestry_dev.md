# This proposal aims to start-up the Agroforestry development process within the Liminal 

The projects presents about 3 hectares of land potentially managed through an agroforest installation 

Main proposal is to have a 3x4 implant including plants from CO2 sequestration processes as well as for bees feeding. 
there are two main companies I will refer to : 17tons.earth and 3bee.com. Both companies offer compensation to plant trees. Minimum compensation for tree is 2€. 
During the winter the project can plant 1200 trees to populate the lines with a net income of 2400€.
This will allow first development of agroforestry lines potentially extendable to fruit and veggies over than aromatic plants.

Contact with 17 Tons is active - I am going to reach out to 3bees to check on the procedure

First 600 pawlonias can be planted in October - if agreed on time we can start preparing the holes in advance and dividing the work so to do not have problems for the overall planting procedure. 
If we prepare the land in advance when the plants arrive we just need to set them in place and protect them from the witer frost. If we start making the holes in 10 holes per person per 10 days we will have all the holes ready in 20 days. 
We can plan around the planting considering number of people on site and rythm of holes creation to host also 3bees plants and protect them from the frost too. Hypothising we will start the procedure in late august we shall have the 600 holes ready for the end of september and set the protection for the frost within the beginning of december 

This will bring an income of 1200€ within the end of September. My proposal is to split the income in the form of 30% to the host organization (possibly a coop) with the commitment of reinvesting it in the development of further regen projects in the area - 80% to split among the workers taking care of the agroforest development (workers will cover their expenses in staying over than further expenses to accomplish their tasks on site)
Same for the second round with 3bees 

The process can be repeated at need to reinvest in the acquisition of fruit trees or other plants and bring a circularization dynamic within the project where income from the planting can be reinvested in rewarding workers, acquiring new plants, develop irrigation systems, further buiding soil, developing natural design on site to regenerate the property.

# Liminal Village Waste Streams

Initiated by Simona Rossi, 2023-07-28
To start to organise a system for dealing with the compost, garbage, and recycling on site

# Compost Reorganisation


The current compost has a very low quality and it takes too much time to process it in these conditions. Usually the compost is produced if well done in three months and we can have continuous production using the right tools.
I propose to adapt the normal grinder to a version not connected to the sink but

Total budget between 1000€ and 2500 € depending on chosen solutions. 

# Rubbish logistics proposal

Install mediumsly large rubbish bins 50 LT under the kitchen window outside divided by categories - paper, plastic, glass, not recyclable 
Install mediumsly large bins 50 LT in the outside corridor in the backyard of the upper house next to the solar panel station - same categorization as below
Instal big bins in the upper parking lot at the entrance 240 LT
Use normal bins under the sinks and in the kitchens of the buildings 
All bins used indoor (16 LT) need to have plastic bags except for the organic one that will be treated as described above and redirected to the compost. Bags will be mainly paper ones (the ones used for the fruit or bags from groceries - (https://www.retif.it/borsa-sos-kraft-marrone-26x43-5-17cm-da-200.html)

Also plastic bags coming from the municipality can be used BUT reused at least 3 times before being thrown away.
The rubbish will be at first collected in the stations in proximity of the houses and then moved bag by bag to the biggest bins in the parking area.
Every person leaving the property can take as much as rubbish fits in their car to dump it in the municipality bins. 
Total Budget = bags + bins about 500€

Liminal Village Waste Streams

Initiated by Simona Rossi, 2023-07-28
To start to organise a system for dealing with the compost, garbage, and recycling on site

# Compost Reorganisation

The current compost has a very low quality and it takes too much time to process it in these conditions. Usually the compost is produced if well done in three months and we can have continuous production using the right tools.

Get 2 or 3 rotating composters (Sun – Mar 400 – 100 Gallons), rotating compost bins - https://www.amazon.com/Sun-Mar-400-100-Gallon-Rotating-Compost/dp/B001CFKVQU - https://www.peoplepoweredmachines.com/sunmar/200inside.html  

Get an intelligent bin (Ariete ecowe 2001) or create an adaptation of the classic rubbish grinder for the sink to make the organic matter much thinner but with no connection to the water flow. (https://www.amazon.it/dp/B004NOY3BQ?th=1&psc=1 - https://www.amazon.it/Ariete-2001-Intelligente-Smaltimento-Essiccazione/dp/B0BFDLDKWH/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=compattatore+rifiuti&sr=8-9 - https://www.iltarlopress.it/40-la-migliore-pattumiera-automatica-del-2022-non-acquistare-una-pattumiera-automatica-finche-non-leggi-questo/ )

We need to evaluate if the hitting from the intelligent bin will degrade the organic matter and so the compost will have a lower quality. The intelligent bin actually dries the organic matter creating problems to the fermentation process that usually makes the compost a good one. 

I propose to adapt the normal grinder to a version not connected to the sink but applicable directly on the organic bin functioning with a glass of water. This will allow the organic matter to stay humid while smashed and 100 gallons can be filled in a very long time. The rotation and the addition of other organic inputs will create a good compost in less time. 

Total budget between 1000€ and 2500 € depending on chosen solutions. 

# Rubbish logistics proposal

Install mediumsly large rubbish bins 50 LT under the kitchen window outside divided by categories - paper, plastic, glass, not recyclable 
Install mediumsly large bins 50 LT in the outside corridor in the backyard of the upper house next to the solar panel station - same categorization as below
Instal big bins in the upper parking lot at the entrance 240 LT
Use normal bins under the sinks and in the kitchens of the buildings 

All bins used indoor (16 LT) need to have plastic bags except for the organic one that will be treated as described above and redirected to the compost. Bags will be mainly paper ones (the ones used for the fruit or bags from groceries - (https://www.retif.it/borsa-sos-kraft-marrone-26x43-5-17cm-da-200.html)
https://www.manomano.it/p/set-3-pattumiere-ecoplus-50lt-ecp50-tris-bidoni-grandi-spazzatura-differenziata-12203277 ) 

Also plastic bags coming from the municipality can be used BUT reused at least 3 times before being thrown away.

The rubbish will be at first collected in the stations in proximity of the houses and then moved bag by bag to the biggest bins in the parking area.

Every person leaving the property can take as much as rubbish fits in their car to dump it in the municipality bins. 

Total Budget = bags + bins about 500€
